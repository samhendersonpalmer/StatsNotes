## Everything I Know About Stats (Notes)

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). It uses the Gitbook template option.

To use:

1. Open project file in RStudio
2. Pull from Github then make a branch to work on
3. Make changes to rmd files only
3. To view changes as you make them, use the "Preview Book" option under "Addins" in toolbar
