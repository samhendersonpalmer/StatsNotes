Or Ben Goldacres definition (from page 60 of “It’s a bit more complicated than that”): “it means that if you repeatedly took samples of a hundred, then on 95 per cent of those attempts, the true [parameter] would lie somewhere between the upper and lower limits of the 95 per cent confidence intervals of yout samples.” 1.2 General programming tips 1.2.1 This book To preview a specific page to prevent building the whole thing just do bookdown::preview_chapter(\"01-intro.Rmd\", 'bookdown::gitbook') 1.2.2 Project structure - Example of this here README.md - Project overview, usage and dependencies setup.R - Install and loads required packages (called at the top of each script) utils.R - General utility functions (i.e. custom functions used within scripts repeatedly) datasets/ - Stores raw and cleaned data scripts/ - Holds processing, viz and analysis scripts plots/ - Saves generated images and plots tables/ - Store exported analysis tables fonts/ (if needed for custom viz) 1.3 Quotes “We are barraged, every day, with a vast quantity of numerical data, presented with absolute certainty and fetishistic precision. In reality, many of these numbers amount to nothing more than statistical noise, the gentle static fuzz of random variation and sampling error, making figures drift up and down, following no pattern at all, like the changing roll of a dice. This, I confidently predict, will never change” Ben Goldacre, pg 61 “It’s a bit more complicated than that” 1.4 Fundamental principles of probability 1.4.1 Axioms 1.4.2 Addition law 1.4.3 Complementary rule 1.4.4 Conditional probability 1.4.5 Multiplication law 1.4.6 Rule of total probability 1.4.7 Bayes theorem 1.5 Random Variables 1.5.1 Discrete random variables 1.5.1.1 Probability mass function 1.5.1.2 Cumulative distribution function 1.5.2 Continuous random variables 1.5.2.1 Probability density function 1.5.2.2 Cumulative distribution function 1.6 Summary statistics of random variables and their distributions 1.6.1 Expectation 1.6.2 Moments and linear functions 1.6.2.1 Linear functions of a random variable 1.6.2.2 Examples 1.7 Probability distributions "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
